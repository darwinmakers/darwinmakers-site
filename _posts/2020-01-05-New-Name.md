Darwin Web Standards started back in April 2011 with monthly catchups at the pub. I was fortunate enough to get involved in 2016 and have seen the group grow, shrink and grow again through a number of iterations. Since it's inception in 2013 we've had 53 meetups at at lucky 13 locations and have built up some 154 members on meetup. It's been a busy few years! 2019 saw some changes as we joined forces with the Darwin Hackerspace and saw presentations in a range of topics beyond the original web focus. So to bring in the new decade we have redefined ourselves as the Darwin Maker Community and will continue to welcome talks to web design, development and infrastructure but we will also have more talks on 3D printing, electronics, microcontrollers, drones, etc... If you're making something cool, we'd love to hear about it.

With the new name we've also moved to a new home. We will continue to share out meetings in meetup for the next few months but will be focused on this blog. We will not only share out updates but will also endevour to share a summary and slides of the talks and presentations that we have to preserve them for future reference. Because we are all about getting hands on and making stuff, anyone is welcome to contribue to the blog. Everything is built in Jekyll on Github Pages and we welcome pull requests for any corrections or contributions. We'll be happy to provide any help or advice on the Slack channel.

We will keep the existing Darwin Web Standards slack channel and will close the Darwin Hackerspace channel to bring everyone together. If you're not already on there come join us at [https://slack.darwinwebstandards.org/](https://slack.darwinwebstandards.org/)
