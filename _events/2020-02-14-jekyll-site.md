The new website for Darwin Maker Community has been a great chance to learn to use Jekyll to generate static sites and to leverage GitHub tools to provide both a collaboration environment and free hosting. The goal was to create a public page that any community members can edit by raising a pull request. We've had some fantastic talks at Darwin Web Standards and Darwin Hackerspace over the past few years but it is difficult to go back over topics that have been previously covered. The goal of this site is to not only replace meeting and provide basic information about the community but to work with speakers to transform their presentations into blog posts for future reference. Concequently, a key goal in the development of the site has been to facilitate and encourage collaboration. This talk will not only cover the basics of setting up and using a Jekyll site on GitHub pages but will also outline how you can engage with and contribute to the site.
